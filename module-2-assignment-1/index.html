        Pizza is a type of food that was created in Italy. It is made by putting
        "Toppings" (such as cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes,
        spices and herbs) over a piece of bread covered with sauce; most often
        tomato, but sometimes butter-based sauces are used. (The piece of bread
        is usually called a "pizza crust".) Almost any kind of topping can be put
        over a pizza. The toppings people use are different in different parts of
        the world. Pizza comes from Italy, from Neapolitan cuisine, but has become
        popular in many parts of the world.

        A drink or beverage is a liquid that you can take into your body, by
        using your mouth. Typical drinks for humans include water, tea, milk,
        coffee, juice, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. All drinks are mainly
        water. All life needs water to live. Plants take in water through their
        roots, which are found underground. Most animals get water by drinking.
        To drink means to take a drink into your body.
