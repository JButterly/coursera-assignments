        <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
        <p><b>Beef</b> is a type of meat that comes from cattle. There are different
          types of beef. Beef is popular in the United States. Beef derives from
          the German word 'beife', meaning grazing beast. Beef can also mean a
          rivalry or feud between people in slang.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">Types of beef.</p>
        <p><b>Ground beef</b> is a ground meat made of beef. it is used in many
          recipes including hamburgers and cottage pie.
        </p>
        <p><b>Steak</b> (not to be confused with 'stake') is a slice off a larger
          piece of meat, usually beef. In North America, steaks are usually grilled.
          They are also often pan-fried or broiled. The most tender (softest) cuts
          of the animal are usually used for steak. This also means that steaks
          have a high price. The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut
          across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them appear more tender.
        </p>
        <p><b>Corned beef</b> is a cut of beef that has been pickled or cured in brine.
          Corned beef is a common meat in deli sandwiches. Corned beef is eaten by
          people on Saint Patrick's Day with cabbage.

        <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
        <p><b>Sushi</b> is a traditional food from Japan. It is a popular dish in other
          countries as well, such as America, Canada, and the UK, along with many
          other countries. Sushi is made with specially prepared rice. The rice is
          mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi also contains raw or cooked
          seafood, and sometimes vegetables as well. Sometimes sushi is wrapped in a
          sheet of seaweed called nori.
          There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is
          nigirizushi: fish that is placed on top of a small portion of sushi rice.
          Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of rice, such as egg instead
          of fish. Makizushi consists of rice rolled around fish and/or vegetables.
          In America, makizushi is more popular than nigirizushi. Another type is known
          as temaki or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created
          by the nori wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled
          with a mixture of rice, fish, and vegetables.
          Sushi can be eaten with hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly
          eaten with sushi. Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside
          a plate of sushi, used as a palate cleanser.
          In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in "conveyor-belt shops" called kaiten zushi,
          where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers.
          People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate
          shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more
          popular in other countries as well.
